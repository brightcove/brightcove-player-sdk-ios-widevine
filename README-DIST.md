# Widevine Plugin for Brightcove Player SDK for iOS, version 1.0.6.143


Installation
===========

Widevine Plugin for Brightcove Player SDK for iOS can be installed through Cocoapods. In order to install the pod, you must first install the [BCOVSpecs](https://github.com/brightcove/BCOVSpecs) cocoapods repository by executing `pod repo add BCOVSpecs https://github.com/brightcove/BCOVSpecs.git` from the command line. Then include `Brightcove-Player-SDK-Widevine` in your podfile.

To install through Xcode, add libBCOVWidevine.a and accompanying header files to your header search path. You **must** manually add the Widevine SDK to your project along with dependencies.

Quick Start
===========
```objc

	    NSString *token;      // (Brightcove Media API token with URL access)
	    NSString *playlistID; // (ID of the playlist you wish to use)
	
	    BCOVPlayerSDKManager *manager = [BCOVPlayerSDKManager sharedManager];
	[1] id<BCOVPlaybackController> controller = [playbackManager createWidevinePlaybackControllerWithViewStrategy:nil]viewStrategy:nil];
	    [self.view addSubview:controller.view];
	
	    BCOVCatalogService *catalog = [[BCOVCatalogService alloc] initWithToken:token];
	[2] [catalog findWidevinePlaylistWithPlaylistID:playlistID
	                             parameters:nil
	                             completion:^(BCOVPlaylist *playlist,
	                                          NSDictionary *jsonResponse,
	                                          NSError      *error) {
	
	                                 [controller setVideos:playlist];
	                                 [controller play];
	                                 
	                             }];
	
```
Let's break this code down into steps, to make it a bit simpler to digest:

1. BCOVWidevine adds some category methods to BCOVPlaybackManager. The first of these is `-createWidevinePlaybackControllerWithViewStrategy`. Use this method to create your playback controller. Alternatively (if you are using more than one session provider), you can create a BCOVWidevineSessionProvider and pass that to the manager method that creates a playback controller with upstream session providers.\*
1. BCOVWidevine adds some category methods to BCOVPlaybackManager for retrieving Widevine renditions from the catalog.

\* Note that BCOVWidevineSessionProvider should come before any ad session providers in the chain passed to the manager when constructing the playback controller.

Customizing Plugin Behavior
===========

You can customize default plugin behavior by creating an instance of `BCOVWidevineSessionProviderOptions` and overriding the default properties. To use a `BCOVWideSessionProviderOptions` options instance, you need to create the `BCOVWideSessionProvider` using `-[BCOVSDKManager createWidevineSessionProviderWithOptions:]`.

```objc

    BCOVWidevineSessionProviderOptions *options = [[BCOVWidevineSessionProviderOptions alloc] init];
    options.widevineSettings = @{ WVPlayerDrivenAdaptationKey: @1 };
    id<BCOVPlaybackSessionProvider> sessionProvider = [playbackManager createWidevineSessionProviderWithOptions:options];

    id<BCOVPlaybackController> playbackController = [playbackManager createPlaybackControllerWithSessionProvider:sessionProvider viewStrategy:nil];
```
